systemPipeR
===

Convenience utilities to run command-line software for NG sequence analysis 
from within R. Supports interactive job submissions on a single machine or 
batch submissions to a queuing system (currently tested only with Torque) of 
a compute cluster.

### Usage
Instructions for running _systemPipe.R_ are given in _analysis.R_. The expected
format to define the RNA-Seq samples (e.g. FASTQ files) and their labels
are given in _targets.txt_ and _targetsPE.txt_ (latter is for PE reads). Currently, 
supported command-line software includes:

 - Bowtie 2
 - TopHat 2
